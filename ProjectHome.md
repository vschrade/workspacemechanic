## Goal ##
To provide easy migration of enterprise workspace settings for Eclipse users.

## News ##
Workspace Mechanic is now in maintenance mode. What this means:
  * Critical bugs fixed only.
  * No new features (with very rare exceptions.)
  * I will accept well-written patch, which must contain thorough tests. But I recommend filing a bug first.

## Access ##

You can get plug-ins from the [update site](http://workspacemechanic.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git.update/mechanic).

## Overview ##
The Workspace Mechanic automates maintenance of your Eclipse environment by tweaking preferences, adding extension locations, and so on. You can use it to:

  * Create a consistent environment among groups as large as the entire company, your local team, or even among your own many workspaces
  * Save time setting up new workspaces
  * Create tasks that ensure your favorite new preferences are applied to all your current and future workspaces. (This is one of our favorite features!)

(See more in [Overview](Overview.md).)

The Workspace Mechanic has been used extensively on Linux and tested on OSX.

**The Workspace Mechanic works with Eclipse 3.5 (not 3.5.0) and all versions thereafter, and requires Java 1.5 or later.**

**Note:** The Workspace Mechanic for Eclipse is still in flux; the API will change before the 1.0 release.
