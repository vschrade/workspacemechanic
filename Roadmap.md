# Introduction #

For the most part, we've been using a version of this tool for quite a while already, so the tasks for bringing this to a 1.0 release aren't very big.

The roadmap is still a bit of a draft, so your feedback is welcome.

# Draft 1.0 Candidate Tasks #

**Functional:**
  * Provide an update site. (**Done**)
  * Complete the keyboard bindings task  (**Done**)
  * Specify task via URL (UrlScannerDesignDoc)  (**Done**)
**Cleanup:**
  * Core vs UI separation
  * Remove dependency on MYLYN  (**Done**)
  * Remove deprecation warnings as of eclipse 3.5 (**Done**)
  * Refactor classes to improve package structure and minimize exposed API.

**No longer tasks for 1.0 release**:
  * Publish groovy plug-in
  * Move to guava

**Timeline:**
  * Estimated release is September 1. (Wow, we missed that, didn't we?)
