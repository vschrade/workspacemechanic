## Contributor License Agreements ##

We look forward to your patches. Before we can accept them, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement. There are two types of agreements, one for [individuals](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html) and one for [corporations](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html). Please read for details.

From the individual contributor agreement: "This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Google; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose."
