# Applying Changes #

Currently, the mechanic doesn't make any changes without your approval. You'll know the mechanic has changes to make when you see:
  * a small orange icon with an exclamation point in the status bar at the bottom of the Eclipse main window

  * a notification dialog in the bottom right corner of your monitor

Click on either the icon or the notification dialog to open the `Workspace Mechanic` window.

The `Workspace Mechanic` window allows you to apply tasks (i.e. make changes to your Eclipse installation or workspace), to block them temporarily, and to block them permanently. Each task has an action associated with it. You can select from three actions:

  * `Fix Now` causes the change to be applied.
  * `Fix Later` causes no action to be taken. The task will reappear next time you open the window, and the task icon will remain orange until the task is applied.
  * `Never Fix` causes the task to be added to a list of blocked tasks.

Actions are taken once the `OK` button is clicked. Clicking the `Cancel` button causes no action to be taken and all input to be ignored.
